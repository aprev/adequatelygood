Ben Cherry is a Web Performance Engineer at [Slide, Inc.](http://www.slide.com), where he works on the [SuperPoke! Pets](http://www.superpokepets.com) team.

When he started this blog, he thought he'd be writing a lot about Python, but was surprised to discover that he really likes JavaScript, so he mostly writes about that instead.
